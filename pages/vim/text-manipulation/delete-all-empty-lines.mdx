# delete all empty lines

```vim
:%g/^$/d
```

Let's break down the command, and see what it does.

`%` applies the command to the entire text file, 
and `g` stands for 'global', meaning it will affect all matching lines.

`/^$/` is a regular expression, which matches empty lines. `^` indicates the start of the line and `$` signifies the end, so `^$` matches lines that contain nothing. `d` deletes the matched lines.

## delete within a visual selection

What if you have a visual selection, and you want to apply the command to that selection?

```vim
:'<,'>g/^$/d
```

`:'<,'>` specifies the range over which the command will apply. In Vim, ﻿'< and ﻿'> both refer to the start and end of the current visual selection. `'<` represents the start, and `'>` represents the end.

So what you're saying is: within the start and the end of my visual selection, get all lines that contain nothing `/^$/` and then delete them with `d`

If you run the command whilst in selection mode, the `:'<,'>` bit will automatically appear, so you don't have to type it out.

You will notice that the command is almost identical to the one above, it's just that we're applying it to the selection, as opposed to the whole file.
