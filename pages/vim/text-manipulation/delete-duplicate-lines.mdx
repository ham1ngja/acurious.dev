# delete duplicate lines

The command to delete duplicate lines is

```vim
:!uniq
```

This command requires a selection to be in place, to work. Also, it only removes duplicate lines that are next to each other. It won't remove duplicates further down the line.

If you want to remove all duplicates, and you're ok with the lines being sorted, you can use `:sort u` which sorts the list alphabetically and then removes duplicate lines.

```vim
:sort u
```
