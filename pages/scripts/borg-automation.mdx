# borg automation

I use `borg` in order to keep my important files backed up on my macOS machine. I've put together a simple script, which enables me to have a lot of control over the backup.

This is the script, however, if you want to learn more, or you want to understand what the script does, step by step, I've written [an article about it](/backup/borgbackup.mdx).


```bash
#!/bin/bash
 
echo -e "\n[$(date +"%T")] Local Borg Backup Initialising.\n"
 
echo "Backing up Brewfile..."

rm -f ~/.config/brew/Brewfile && brew bundle dump --file=~/.config/brew/Brewfile
 
echo -e "Brewfile has been backed up.\n"
 
paths=(
"/path"
"/more/paths"
)
 
BORG_PASSPHRASE=$(security find-generic-password -a borg -s BorgBackup -w) borg create --stats --progress ~/borg/borg.local::'local-{now:%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S}' "${paths[@]}"
 
rsync -av --delete ~/borg/borg.local "/Volumes/borg" ; rsync -av --delete ~/borg/borg.local "/Volumes/borg.ssd"
 
echo -e "\n[$(date +"%T")] Local Borg Backup Complete. \n\n"
```
