# brew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you use Linux, you'll be familiar with the concept, but if you've only ever used macOS or Windows, you may never have encountered one.

It is a bit like the App Store, but it is aimed at developers and power users, who like to work more with the command line. It also offers a vast array of open-source software, many of which are not available on the App Store itself.

Here is how to install it, and how to use it.

## Installation

Open the Terminal and paste this.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will install `brew` on your device.

## Usage

If you want to install an app, it's as easy as this.

```bash
brew install wget
```

If you want to know the installation command for a certain app, the simplest way to do it might be to go to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) and then hit `cmd + K` to search. Interestingly, `/` works as well.

If you ever get lost, you can always do this.

```bash
brew help
```

## Updates

If you want to update your apps, first we need to retrieve the list of any updates that you have installed, which have newer versions available.

```bash
brew update
```

Once this is done, you can upgrade them by doing this.

```bash
brew upgrade
```

If you want to upgrade a specific app only, you can do `brew upgrade <formula>`

## List

If you want to view all of your installed apps, you can do this.

```bash
brew list
```

## Cleanup

After a while, you might end up with outdated downloads, and older versions. If you want to clean them up, just do this.

```bash
brew cleanup
```

If you want to see all the stuff that will be removed first, run this.

```bash
brew cleanup -n
```

## Backup

After you've installed a few apps, you might want to be able to easily access them in a list, so that if you ever have to re-install your OS, you can immediately re-install all of your brew apps.

The way to do it is this.

```bash
brew bundle dump --file=~/.config/brew/Brewfile
```

This script will create a file called `Brewfile` which will contain a list of all installations made through `brew`. In this case, the file is saved in `~/.config/brew/` but you can of course save it anywhere you'd like.

When you want to re-install all the applications, you can use this.

```bash
brew bundle --file=~/.config/brew/Brewfile
```

This will go through the list, and will re-install of your applications on your new machine.

## Conclusion

If you're a dev or a power user, getting `brew` is an absolute must. I hope you have found this to be helpful.
