Next up, it's time we upgrade our SSD and RAM. So, let's turn everything off, and let's have a look at the inner workings of the machine.


## the case

To get inside the case, you need to remove 4 screws from the bottom plate, and then you need to pull on a tab to easily open it. In every video I've seen in which this machine is disassembled, the bottom plate came off easily. In my case, it needed a bit of convincing.

## m.2 SSD

Either way, I got in. The first thing you see is a fan and an M.2 slot. I happen to have a 4 TB M.2 SSD from a different project, so I installed it in this machine. It is only P3, as opposed to the P4 that the machine comes with, but that's fine for most use cases.

Removing the M.2 screw was a bit challenging. The `PH00` screwdriver that I used to remove the plate screws couldn't quite connect to the M.2 screw. Luckily I have a multi-tool, so by using the smaller `PH000` screwdriver head, I was able to easily remove it.

## RAM

Next up, we need to get to the RAM. Four screws need to be removed, two which are in plain sight, and two which are kind of hidden.

WARNING: Make sure to keep track of which screw goes in what hole, as they are different sizes.

Once they were removed, I gently lifted the plate off and gingerly disconnected the bottom fan from the motherboard. I then popped out the existing 32 GB of RAM and plugged in the new 64 GB, which should work as dual-channel, as opposed to the 32 GB sticks, which are single-channel.

Once this was done, I made sure to plug the bottom fan back in, screwed everything back into place, and turned the machine on.

Oh no. Weird whirring noise. Did I plug the fan back in incorrectly?

## troubleshooting

I open it back up, disconnect the fan, and then plug it back in. I turn the machine on; still whirring. Check the connector again. Did I plug it in the wrong way? I check the connector and the pins on the motherboard.

The holes in the connector are not in the middle, but more towards the edge, indicating that there is only one way to plug it in.

I turn the machine back on. The whirring noise of death is back. Is there an issue with the RAM? I removed the new RAM and plugged the old RAM in.

No whirring. Oh no...

After a few seconds of panic, I realised it couldn't be the RAM. So I remove the old chips and put the new ones back in. All the sticks are DDR5, and they have the same frequency of 5600MHz. The new chips are just a larger size, which I know the machine can handle.

I reconnect the fan one more time, for good luck, and I press the power button. No weird whirring. The machine is purring like a kitten!

So after my immense success, I screw everything back in, connect the Ethernet cable to the back of the machine, and oh no. My MacBook can't detect the Ethernet connection. I can't get into my server, even though it seems to be running just fine.

## network

Time for some more troubleshooting. I disconnect the Ethernet cable from the back of the SER7, and I connect it to an old MacBook Air, via an adaptor. The connection is immediately spotted by the M1 MacBook.

Ok, so there's no issue with the cable or the dock that the other end is connected to. The issue is with the SER7.

Did I accidentally damage the Ethernet port somehow during the upgrade? Unlikely, so let's investigate further.

I keep the Network window open on my M1, and I reset the SER7, with the cable connected. The connection appears briefly after the reboot, and it immediately disappears once the server is up and running.

Interesting. The server was installed before the upgrade, so, some of the new components are somehow interfering with things. I'm sure there's a very big-brained way to solve this on the actual server itself, but I just installed Proxmox 24 hours prior, so the small-brained option it is, then.

I reboot the SER7 from my USB drive, and I re-install Proxmox. When I got to the window that allows you to configure the IP address and such, there was a green light next to the connection. That looks promising.

I let the install finish, I connect from my M1, and bam, it works!
