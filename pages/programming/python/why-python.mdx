# why python?

The first time I used Python, in fell in love with its simplicity. Before we continue, I want to add that a simple programming language must not be confused with a rudimentary one.

Python can do a lot. However, it differentiates itself from other languages, such as Java, for example, by avoiding boilerplate code, and thus freeing the programmer up to focus on logic instead.

With that being said, Python has its downsides. The simplicity comes at a cost, and that is relatively low efficiency. This can be a problem when a snippet of code is run billions of times, as the milliseconds add up. 

However, in my case, I will mostly be using it in the context of Cybersecurity and IT. For my use case, being able to quickly write a program that solves a problem is more important than saving split seconds, as the code will be run a handful of times, instead of millions, or even billions.
